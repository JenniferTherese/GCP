**Create service account** <br>
A type of account used by programs/apps instead of people. For example, I create an app that upload file to cloud storage and run a ML model. My app needs permission to do all these. That's where a service account comes in. They have roles and permissions just like a user.<br>
**steps**
1. create a service account in GCP <br>
2. Give it a role "storage admin" <br>
3. download the key-file (.json)
